## Create a GitHub Account

A GitHub account is required for publication / sharing of AppExchange Demo Kit (ADK) projects.  For detailed instructions on setting up a free account, see ["Join GitHub"][JOIN_GITHUB].

#### GitHub is recommended, but not required, for AppExchange Package Kit (APK) projects

**APK projects can be used with other Git-based repository hosts (eg. BitBucket).**
</div></div>

## Install / Configure Git

Once you have a GitHub account (or an account from another Git Host if using the AppExchange Package Kit), you will need to install and configure Git on your local machine.  For detailed instructions, see ["Set up Git"][SETUP_GIT]. 

## Create a Repository

Salesforce DX uses source-driven development model.  This means that your projects will be centered around a repository instead of an org.

Setting up an empty, remote repository is an important first step when creating both AppExchange Demo Kit (ADK) and AppExchange Package Kit (APK) projects.  For detailed instructions, see ["Creating a new Repository"][CREATE_REPO]

## Invite Collaborators

**Optional.** If you plan on developing with a team, you will want to add collaborators to your GitHub repository.  The way to do this depends on whether you're working with a Personal or Organization repository.
