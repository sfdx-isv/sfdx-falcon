The best way to get started with the **SFDX-Falcon** plugin is by creating a sample **AppExchange Demo Kit (ADK)** project.  

ADK projects allow Salesforce Developers to build and share rich, dynamic demo orgs in a source-centric manner without requiring batch files or shell scripts.  

###### Here's a look at the ADK install engine at work:

Anyone who has installed the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) and the [SFDX-Falcon Plugin](https://github.com/sfdx-isv/sfdx-falcon) can install any ADK Demo with three simple commands.

```
$ sfdx falcon:adk:clone https://github.com/VivekMChawla/adk-sample.git

$ cd adk-sample

$ sfdx falcon:adk:install
```

**Want to try for yourself?**  These instructions will help you install the [SFDX-Falcon CLI Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sfdx-falcon), clone an AppExchange Demo Kit (ADK) starter project, and distribute your first ADK project to others.
