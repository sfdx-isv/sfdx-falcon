title: Jekyll Theme
---

The theme has been refactored by [Guillermo Calvo](https://guillermo.in/) as a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/) to
be easily usable in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Activate this theme by adding a new line to your `_config.yml` file:

```
remote_theme: leakyabstractions/pretty-docs
```

Here is an example of a GitHub Pages site using this theme:
